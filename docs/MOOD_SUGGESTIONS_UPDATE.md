# Mood-Based Song Suggestions - Updated Implementation

## What Was Changed

### ❌ Previous Implementation Issues

- Used deprecated Spotify `/recommendations` API endpoint
- Basic genre selection (random genre from list)
- Limited search strategies
- Getting 404 errors from Spotify API

### ✅ New Implementation Features

#### 1. **Smart Genre Selection**

- Analyzes mood using the advanced mood analyzer
- Maps each mood to the most appropriate genre from the genres array
- Priority-based genre selection for better music matching

#### 2. **Multiple Search Strategies**

All using the stable Spotify `/search` API:

- **Direct genre search**: `genre:"pop"`
- **Genre + mood keywords**: `genre:"pop" upbeat OR cheerful`
- **Genre + mood descriptors**: `genre:"pop" upbeat positive`
- **Recent popular tracks**: `genre:"pop" year:2020-2024`
- **Alternative genre fallback**: Uses second genre if available

#### 3. **Mood-to-Genre Mapping**

```javascript
happy → pop, dance, funk, reggae, disco, house
sad → blues, indie, folk, alternative, acoustic, singer-songwriter
angry → rock, metal, punk, hardcore, grunge, industrial
relaxed → ambient, chillout, lo-fi, jazz, classical, new-age
energetic → electronic, edm, techno, house, drum-and-bass, hardstyle
romantic → r&b, soul, jazz, pop, indie-pop, soft-rock
nostalgic → classic-rock, oldies, folk, country, indie, alternative
anxious → indie, alternative, electronic, ambient, post-rock, experimental
confident → hip-hop, rap, trap, rock, pop, funk
thoughtful → jazz, classical, ambient, post-rock, indie, neo-soul
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Track Scoring**

- Mood fit scoring based on track popularity
- Keyword matching in track names
- Era-based scoring (recent tracks for energetic moods, older for nostalgic)
- Removes duplicates and ranks by relevance
